## Game Style

```
The game is divided into several well-designed levels (dungeons).

The player's main weapon is his gauntlets. As they crave for violence, the player is able to use a 'berserk mode', which has it's own benefits and drawbacks.

The player loses damage if he is surrounded by enemies and only has his full damage when he is fighting one-on-one.

The dungeons will have traps player can use to slow down certain enemies or keep them still while he fights other enemies.

The player is able to teleport almost whenever and wherever he wants.

The emenies have a clear sight radius so the player can strategize around that.
